# Geospatial_Data_Learning

## Description: 
Repo containing small introductory projects related to geospatial data. Used mostly for learning purposes and to gain experience working with geospatial data.

## Folder Contents:
- __IBM_Intro_Projects__: Folder containing intro projects following the Introduction to Using Geospatial Data in Python series on IBM. Go [here](https://developer.ibm.com/learningpaths/data-analysis-using-python/) to see turotial.
    - __ibm_geospatial_vector.ipynb__: Juptyer notebook following the tutorial [here](https://developer.ibm.com/learningpaths/data-analysis-using-python/working-with-geospatial-vector-data-in-python/).

## Project Setup:
When setting up this project locally, I first created a virtual environment utilizing python's built-in environment builder. Then I installed requirements for the specific python programs. These requirements are in requirements.txt. Follow the steps below to replicate setup of project environment:

1. In terminal in current project folder: 

    `python -m venv venv`
2. Then, also in terminal: 

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
